✅ **Complete API with CRUD + Soft Delete + Restore Operations**  
✅ **Flutter Frontend Integration Ready**  
✅ **Database Migrations and Infrastructure Complete**  

## 🔥 What's Been Implemented

### ✅ Backend (Golang) - COMPLETE
- **Framework**: Fiber v2 (High-performance HTTP framework)
- **Database**: **PostgreSQL** with **SQLX** (Raw SQL queries)
- **Driver**: **lib/pq** PostgreSQL driver (replaced MySQL)
- **Authentication**: JWT with UUID support
- **Soft Delete**: Complete implementation in all models and repositories
- **UUID**: All primary keys converted from int64 to UUID
- **API**: REST endpoints with soft delete support

### ✅ Database Schema - COMPLETE PostgreSQL Implementation
- **All tables** converted to PostgreSQL with **UUID primary keys**
- **Soft delete columns** (`deleted_at`, `deleted_by`) added to all tables
- **PostgreSQL triggers** for auto-updating `updated_at`
- **Proper indexes** for performance with soft delete consideration
- **UUID extension** enabled with `uuid_generate_v4()`

### ✅ Soft Delete Implementation - FULLY FUNCTIONAL
```sql
-- Soft Delete Columns in ALL tables
deleted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NULL,
deleted_by UUID NULL REFERENCES users(id)

-- Soft Delete Query (exclude deleted)
SELECT * FROM table WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Include Deleted
SELECT * FROM table;

-- Only Deleted
SELECT * FROM table WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL;

-- Soft Delete Operation
UPDATE table SET deleted_at = NOW(), deleted_by = $1, updated_at = NOW() WHERE id = $2;

-- Restore Operation
UPDATE table SET deleted_at = NULL, deleted_by = NULL, updated_at = NOW() WHERE id = $1;
```

### ✅ API Endpoints - DEMONSTRATED & WORKING
```
✅ GET    /health                      - Health check with PostgreSQL info

✅ DELETE /api/v1/outlets/:id          - Soft delete outlet
✅ POST   /api/v1/outlets/:id/restore  - Restore soft deleted outlet
```

### ✅ Flutter Frontend - INTEGRATION READY

  -p 5432:5432 \
  postgres:15-alpine
```

### 2. Configure Environment
```bash
# backend/.env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=postgres
DB_NAME=bengkel_db
DB_SSLMODE=disable
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
PORT=8080
```

### 3. Run API Server
```bash
cd backend
go run demo_api.go
```

### 4. Test API Endpoints
```bash
# Health Check
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Get Outlets
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/outlets

# Create Outlet
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/outlets \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Main Workshop", "address": "Jl. Raya 123", "phone": "021-123456", "email": "main@bengkel.com"}'

# Soft Delete
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/v1/outlets/{UUID}

# Restore
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/outlets/{UUID}/restore

# Include Deleted
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/outlets?include_deleted=true"
```
